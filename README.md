# Car_price_prediction
This is a mini project on Machine Learning.

The objective of the project is to build a model to predict car prices and provide insights on which kind of cars to manufacture if Geely Auto is planning to set up a manufacturing factory in US to compete with American and European companies in USA.

Models used: Linear regrssion, KNeighborsRegressor, SGDRegressor, RandomForestRegressor, DecisionTreeRegressor, AdaBoostRegressor, XGBoostRegressor
